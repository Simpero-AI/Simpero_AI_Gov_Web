## Problem restatement

Step 3 of the deal wizard ("Start Analysis") currently POSTs multipart form data to
`/api/simpero/analyse`, an endpoint that does not exist in this repo. Replace it with a real
endpoint that takes only a `dealId`, enqueues a job on this app's own `"simpero"` queue, and has
that job fan the deal's already-uploaded documents (via the existing `data_sources` /
presigned-upload flow, see SIM-220/SIM-216) out to the parser service's `"parse"` queue — plus an
honest status model the frontend can poll, and a path for the parser's `no_extractable_text`
signal (SIM-350) to land back on `data_source.status`.

By the time a user reaches this step, every uploaded document already has a `data_sources` row
with a `storage_key`, created by `POST /api/uploads/{upload_id}/complete` (`app/api/uploads.py`),
which already enqueues `ingest_data_source` for hash verification. This design starts from that
row set — it does not touch the upload flow.

## Verified findings (file:line)

**Queues and jobs**
- `app/jobs/queue.py:14` — this app's own queue, name `"simpero"`, lazy `Queue.from_url`.
- `app/jobs/worker.py:6-10` — worker settings, `concurrency: 10`, no `before_process` hook.
- `app/jobs/tasks/ingest_data_source.py:1-11` — the mandatory worker-task pattern to copy: no
  `Depends(get_db)` (this runs in a SAQ worker, not a FastAPI request), so
  `SELECT set_config('app.org_id', :tid, true)` is issued by hand as the first statement in the
  transaction (`:41-44`); idempotency guard on non-`pending` status (`:62-63`); terminal write via
  `DataSourceRepo.update_status` (`:73`); audit row with `actor_id="Internal System"` (`:74-87`).
- `app/jobs/tasks/__init__.py:1-4` — `functions` list; a new task must be registered here or the
  worker silently never dispatches it.
- `app/jobs/parse_client.py:30` — `PARSE_QUEUE_NAME = "parse"`; `:41-59`
  `enqueue_parse_job(spaces_key, known_sha256s) -> job.key`; `:62-69`
  `get_parse_job(job_key) -> Job | None` (`None` means expired/unknown, not "in progress").
  **Its module docstring (`:12-16`) is stale** — it claims this app "deliberately does not
  depend on boto3 today." It does; see below. Correct that docstring as part of this work.
- `app/api/uploads.py:145-154` — the precedent this design copies: a request handler enqueues on
  `"simpero"` and returns immediately. The comment there warns never to enqueue onto `"parse"`
  directly from a request handler — always enqueue on `"simpero"`, let a worker task do the
  cross-service fan-out.
- `app/api/uploads.py:85-89` — existing 409 precedent ("this already exists") to mirror.

**The parser service's contract (read-only from here — do not edit that repo)**
- `Simpero_Gov_AI_Services/parser_service/worker.py:38-45` — consumer function signature:
  `parse_document(ctx, *, spaces_key, known_sha256s)`. Name and kwargs must match
  `enqueue_parse_job`'s call exactly — SAQ dispatches by function name.
- `worker.py:70-74` — a `ParseError` on the parser's side becomes a **returned dict**, not a
  raised exception on the queue: `{"status": "rejected", "code": exc.code, "message": ...}`. This
  is how `no_extractable_text` (SIM-350's signal) travels back.
- `worker.py:95-102` — success returns `{"status": "parsed", "kind", "sha256", "bucket", "key",
  "count"}` — a Spaces bucket+key pointer to the parsed result, not the parsed body itself.
- `worker.py:105-122` — the parser's own `before_process` hook sets `timeout=1800, retries=2,
  ttl=86400` **on the consumer side**, because SAQ's default job timeout is 10 seconds. This does
  not help the enqueue side — see below.
- **`docling_parser.py:357-367` — trap.** `known_sha256s` is a *duplicate-rejection* list: a
  digest present in it makes the parser raise `ParseError("duplicate_pdf", ..., 409)`. Do **not**
  pass a document's own `fingerprint` here — every parse would be rejected. Pass `None`.
- `docling_parser.py:457-461` — the SIM-350 signal: `ParseError("no_extractable_text", "PDF
  contains no extractable text.", 422)`.

**SAQ semantics (installed version, `.venv/lib/python3.14/site-packages/saq/`)**
- `job.py:110,134` — `Job.result` holds the function's return value; `job.py:89` — `ttl` is "the
  maximum time in seconds to store information about a job **including results**."
- `job.py:26-42` — `Status` enum (`new/queued/active/aborting/aborted/failed/complete`);
  `TERMINAL_STATUSES = {COMPLETE, FAILED, ABORTED}`.
- `queue/base.py:314-331` — `enqueue(job_or_func, **kwargs)`; kwargs are *either* function
  arguments *or* Job properties (`timeout`, `retries`, `ttl`, `key`) merged into one namespace.
  **Never name a task kwarg `timeout`, `key`, `ttl`, or `retries`** — it collides with the Job
  property of the same name.

**Consequence of the above:** `get_parse_job(key).result` gives this app the full outcome dict —
`parsed` vs `rejected`, the rejection `code`, and the bucket+key pointer — with zero Spaces access
needed, for `ttl=86400` (24h) after the parse job finishes.

**Spaces / boto3 (correcting the stale docstring)**
- `pyproject.toml:16` — `"boto3>=1.34.0"` is already a hard dependency; `pyproject.toml:23-25` —
  *"boto3 stays: kept for future Spaces access from this app."*
- `app/services/uploads/spaces.py:1-11` — this app already uses boto3 and *"reuses the parser
  service's bucket"*; `app/core/config.py:36` — `spaces_bucket` aliases the same
  `PARSER_SPACES_BUCKET` env var the parser service uses. There is no missing dependency here.

**Data model constraints**
- `app/models/data_source.py:18` — `_STATUSES` already includes `"ocr_needed"`, never written by
  any current code path.
- **`alembic/versions/d6d2fe8f27ae_data_source.py:119-134` — the actual blocker.** The
  `data_source_enforce_one_way_status()` trigger raises on *any* UPDATE where
  `OLD.status <> 'pending'`. `ingest_data_source` sets `verified` well before any parse runs, so a
  `verified → ocr_needed` UPDATE **will raise**. It fires for every role including the table
  owner — there is no runtime workaround. See "Blocking prerequisite" below.
- `d6d2fe8f27ae:106-110` — `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE ... FROM dd_app` plus
  `GRANT UPDATE (status, fingerprint, status_updated_at) ON data_source TO dd_app`. The column
  grant SIM-350 needs already exists; only the trigger stands in the way.
- `app/repo/DataSourceRepo.py:39-56` — `update_status(id, status, fingerprint)` takes
  `fingerprint` **positionally-required** and writes it unconditionally. Passing `None` here
  would wipe an already-verified hash, and the column grant permits it — a real footgun for the
  SIM-350 write path (see below).
- `DataSourceRepo.py` currently has **no** "list by deal" method — one is needed for this design.
- `alembic/versions/7175bc85ffb0_human_audit_log.py:36` — `event_type` is plain `Text`, no CHECK
  constraint — new event types need no migration.
- `app/models/__init__.py:1` — every model must be imported here for Alembic autogenerate to see
  it.
- No analysis/run model exists anywhere in `app/models/`.

**Status endpoint**
- `app/api/deals.py:202-211` — `GET /deals/{deal_id}/status` unconditionally returns
  `_no_job_status()` (`:43-55`) today — there's no job model to report on yet.
- `app/schemas/deals.py:14-25` — `DealStatusResponse`, `job_status:
  Literal["queued","processing","complete","error","no_job"]`. This design maps onto this exact
  shape, unmodified.
- `app/services/pipeline_steps.py:7-53` — the 9 UI-facing phases; `"parsing"` is phase 1,
  `"classify"` is phase 2.

## Architectural decisions

**D1 — `POST /api/deals/{deal_id}/analysis`, added to the existing deals router.** Analysis is a
sub-resource of a deal. No new router file, no `main.py` change, `_actor` (`deals.py:36-40`) is
already there. No route-ordering hazard: `GET /{deal_id}` can't shadow a POST to a longer path.

**D2 — `dealId` comes from the path, not the body.** `uploads.py` puts `deal_id` in the body only
because `upload_id` owns the path slot there. Here the deal owns the path slot; duplicating it in
the body just creates a mismatch case to validate for no gain.

**D3 — Response is `202 Accepted` + `DealStatusResponse`, reused verbatim.** The frontend's next
move is to navigate to `/analysis/:dealId` and poll `GET /deals/{dealId}/status`, which returns
this exact shape — so the 202 body can seed the query cache directly. No new response schema, no
run-id concept leaking into the frontend. The run id lives in the audit trail for debugging.

**D4 — One new table, `analysis_run`. No child table.** Fan-out is tracked in a `parse_jobs` JSONB
array (`[{data_source_id, storage_key, job_key, outcome, code, bucket, key}]`). A deal has a
handful of documents and nothing queries across them individually; a child table is a second
migration/model/repo for zero present benefit.
`# ponytail: JSONB fan-out array — promote to an analysis_run_document child table if
per-document querying or per-document retry is ever needed.`

**D5 — RLS / role boundary: standard house pattern, one deliberate deviation.**
- Migration runs as `dd_owner` (Alembic). Runtime is `dd_app` only. No blur between the two.
- `ENABLE` **and** `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, `org_isolation` policy `FOR ALL TO dd_app` joining
  `org_id → organisation.clerk_org_id = current_setting('app.org_id', true)` — copy this verbatim
  from `d6d2fe8f27ae:84-98`, don't reinvent it.
- Column grants: `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE ON analysis_run FROM dd_app;` then
  `GRANT UPDATE (status, parse_jobs, error_message, updated_at) ON analysis_run TO dd_app;`.
  Identity columns (`org_id`, `deal_id`, `selected_frameworks`, `created_at`) stay append-only.
- **Deviation, flagged deliberately:** *no* one-way status trigger on this table. `data_source`
  has one because it has exactly one legitimate transition ever. `analysis_run` genuinely walks
  `queued → parsing → parsed|failed` — copying the trigger here would be cargo-culting a
  constraint that contradicts the row's actual purpose.

**D6 — Double-submit is prevented by a partial unique index, not an app-level check.**
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX uq_analysis_run_active ON analysis_run (deal_id)
  WHERE status IN ('queued', 'parsing');
```
The handler does a fast-path SELECT for a friendly 409, but the index is the actual guarantee —
two concurrent requests can both pass a SELECT check before either commits. DB constraint over
app code, same philosophy as the audit-log grants elsewhere in this repo.

**D7 — The request handler enqueues; a worker task does the work.** Exact mirror of
`uploads.py:148-154`. The handler never touches the `"parse"` queue directly.

**D8 — Explicit `timeout`/`retries`/`ttl` on enqueue. SAQ's default timeout is 10 seconds.**
```python
get_queue().enqueue(
    "start_deal_analysis",
    analysis_run_id=str(run.id), deal_id=str(deal_id), clerk_org_id=claims["tenant_id"],
    timeout=7200, retries=1, ttl=86400,
)
```
The parser service hit this exact wall and had to patch it worker-side
(`Simpero_Gov_AI_Services/parser_service/worker.py:105-122`); this app has no `before_process`
hook, so it must be set at enqueue time instead.
**Separate finding, worth its own ticket, not fixed here:** `ingest_data_source` is enqueued with
no timeout override (`uploads.py:148-154`), so it's running under the 10-second default today. A
10MB `stream_and_hash` from Spaces can plausibly exceed that.

**D9 — The worker task fans out *and awaits*, rather than fanning out and exiting.** Alternative
was fan-out-and-exit plus a reconciler (a SAQ cron, or side-effecting writes inside
`GET /status`). Awaiting keeps everything in one file and needs no new infrastructure, and keeps
`GET /status` a pure read. Cost: one of this app's 10 worker slots (`worker.py:9`) is held per
active analysis run, and the parser itself runs at `concurrency: 1`
(`Simpero_Gov_AI_Services/parser_service/worker.py:129`), so a deal's documents serialize
globally on the parser side regardless.
`# ponytail: waits in-worker, ceiling ~10 concurrent analysis runs — switch to fan-out-and-exit
+ a SAQ cron reconciler if runs start queuing behind each other.`

**D10 — The await loop holds no DB session across the wait.** The task must never keep a
transaction open across `asyncio.sleep`. Under PgBouncer transaction pooling that pins a backend
connection for the whole run (up to hours), defeating the pooler. Structure: short transaction →
write → commit → close → sleep → repeat. **Every one of those transactions re-issues
`SELECT set_config('app.org_id', :tid, true)` as its first statement**, per-transaction, never
hoisted — exactly as `ingest_data_source.py:41-44` does it. `clerk_org_id` is passed in as a job
kwarg (same as `ingest_data_source.py:33`), never re-derived inside the loop.

**D11 — The task is idempotent and resumable.** On entry it reads the run row; for each usable
`data_source` it enqueues a parse job **only if no `job_key` is already recorded** for it, then
awaits. A SAQ redelivery or sweeper retry therefore resumes rather than double-enqueuing. Same
spirit as `ingest_data_source.py:57-63`'s idempotency guard.

**D12 — `known_sha256s` is passed as `None`.** Per `docling_parser.py:362-367` it's a
reject-as-duplicate list — passing the document's own `fingerprint` (the intuitive move, given
the field names sit adjacent in the payload) would make every parse fail with `duplicate_pdf`.
Deal-level dedupe already happens at presign time (`uploads.py:82-89`); this isn't that.

**D13 — Usable set = `status == 'verified'` only.** `pending` means ingest hasn't verified the
bytes yet; `quarantined`/`mismatch`/`ocr_needed` are all reasons not to (re-)parse. The endpoint
fast-fails (422 no documents / 409 still verifying) purely for UX; **the worker's read at task
start is authoritative**, so a row that flips `pending → verified` in the gap between the request
and the worker picking up the job is still picked up correctly.

**D14 — Status model: no fake terminal state.** Run statuses `queued | parsing | parsed | failed`
map onto `DealStatusResponse` as:

| run status | `jobStatus` | `currentPhase` | steps |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(no run)* | `no_job` | `null` | all pending — unchanged |
| `queued` | `queued` | `null` | all pending |
| `parsing` | `processing` | `"parsing"` | parsing = current |
| `parsed` | `processing` | `"classify"` | parsing = done, classify = current |
| `failed` | `error` | `"parsing"` | parsing = failed, + `errorMessage` |

`parsed → "complete"` is rejected: the frontend's `DealAnalysis.tsx:1170-1187` would spin for ~2
minutes waiting for a memo that doesn't exist yet, then render an empty tab. `parsed → "error"` is
also rejected: nothing failed. Mapping `parsed` to `processing`/`classify` means the frontend's
progress UI truthfully shows "parsing done, classification hasn't run" — which is exactly the
state of the world — and it becomes correct for free once the LLM/classify stage is eventually
built. **This requires zero changes to the frontend's `dealsStatus` shared type** — the
`jobStatus` union is untouched by this design.

**D15 — A run with zero successful parses is `failed`, with a specific message.** If every
document in the run came back rejected, set `errorMessage` naming why (e.g. *"All 2 documents need
OCR before analysis."*). This is what makes SIM-350 visible to the user rather than a silent DB
column change nobody sees. Mixed outcomes (some parsed, some rejected) → `parsed`, not `failed`.

**D16 — Parse *result bodies* are not read in this phase.** The `bucket`/`key` pointer from
`worker.py:99-100` is recorded in `parse_jobs` and left there — not fetched, not opened. **Named
handoff boundary, not built here:** a future analysis/memo stage consumes
`analysis_run.parse_jobs[].{bucket,key}` via the existing `app/services/uploads/spaces.py` client
and writes a `sessions` row. That stage is out of scope for this design.

**D17 — Zero changes in `Simpero_Gov_AI_Services`.** Its contract (`parse_document` name/kwargs,
the two return-dict shapes) is already exactly what this design needs. See
`start-analysis-flow-services.md` for the read-only confirmation of this.

## API contract (verbatim)

```
POST /api/deals/{deal_id}/analysis
Authorization: Bearer <clerk jwt>
Content-Type: application/json
```

Request — `StartAnalysisRequest(CamelModel)`:
```jsonc
{ "selectedFrameworks": ["...", "..."] }   // optional, nullable; persisted verbatim, not interpreted
```
(See Open Question 3 — this field may be dropped entirely depending on Vansh's answer.)

Responses:

| Code | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| `202` | `DealStatusResponse` — `{ jobStatus: "queued", currentPhase: null, steps: [...all pending], phaseProgress: null, errorMessage: null }` | run created + job enqueued |
| `404` | `{ "detail": "Deal not found" }` | falls out of RLS returning no row, per `deals.py:170-174` — not a manual ownership check |
| `409` | `{ "detail": "Analysis is already running for this deal" }` | active run exists (fast-path SELECT **or** `uq_analysis_run_active` IntegrityError) |
| `409` | `{ "detail": "Documents are still being verified — try again in a moment" }` | ≥1 `pending`, 0 `verified` |
| `422` | `{ "detail": "Upload at least one document before starting analysis" }` | 0 usable and 0 pending |

Handler sequence (all inside the single `get_db` transaction):
1. `DealRepo.get_by_id` → 404 if missing.
2. `DataSourceRepo.list_for_deal(deal_id)` (new method) → partition by status → 409/422 per the
   table above.
3. `AnalysisRunRepo.create({id, org_id, deal_id, selected_frameworks, status: "queued"})`.
4. `get_queue().enqueue("start_deal_analysis", analysis_run_id=str(run.id), deal_id=str(deal_id), clerk_org_id=claims["tenant_id"], timeout=7200, retries=1, ttl=86400)`
   — `"simpero"` queue, **never** `"parse"`.
5. `HumanAuditRepo.append({..., "event_type": "analysis_requested", "deal_id": deal_id, "payload": {"analysis_run_id": ..., "document_count": N}})` with the real `_actor`.
6. Return the 202 body.

## File-level plan (build in this order)

1. `alembic/versions/<rev>_analysis_run.py` — create table + indexes + `ENABLE`/`FORCE` RLS +
   `org_isolation` policy + `REVOKE`/`GRANT` per D5 + `uq_analysis_run_active` partial unique
   index per D6. Docstring must state why there is *no* one-way trigger here (see D5's deviation).
2. `app/models/analysis_run.py` — SQLAlchemy model; register in `app/models/__init__.py`.
3. `app/repo/AnalysisRunRepo.py` — `create`, `get_by_id`, `latest_for_deal(deal_id)`,
   `active_for_deal(deal_id)`, `update_progress(id, *, status, parse_jobs, error_message)`.
   Read-modify-write of `parse_jobs` must use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` within the same transaction.
4. `app/repo/DataSourceRepo.py` — **modify**: add `list_for_deal(deal_id) -> list[DataSource]`.
   Nothing else in this file changes.
5. `app/schemas/deals.py` — **modify**: add `StartAnalysisRequest`. `DealStatusResponse` is
   unchanged.
6. `app/jobs/tasks/start_deal_analysis.py` — **new**, templated directly on
   `ingest_data_source.py` including its module docstring's `SET LOCAL` explanation.
   Responsibility: resolve the run, snapshot usable data sources, enqueue one parse job per
   document (`enqueue_parse_job(storage_key, None)`), record job keys, set run status `parsing`,
   then poll `get_parse_job` on a fixed interval until all keys are terminal or the deadline hits
   (per D8/D9's 2-hour budget), persisting outcomes and applying the SIM-350 write as they land
   (see "Blocking prerequisite" below), then set the run terminal + write the closing audit row.
7. `app/jobs/tasks/__init__.py` — **modify**: register `start_deal_analysis` in `functions`.
8. `app/api/deals.py` — **modify**: add the `POST /{deal_id}/analysis` handler (steps above);
   change `get_deal_status` (`:202-211`) to consult `AnalysisRunRepo.latest_for_deal` and map per
   D14. `_no_job_status()` stays as the no-run branch, unchanged.
9. `app/jobs/parse_client.py` — **modify, docstring only**: correct the stale boto3 claim at
   `:12-16`.

No changes needed in `Simpero_Gov_AI_Services` (D17) — see the companion doc.

## Blocking prerequisite — a DDL decision, not an implementation detail

**`data_source`'s one-way status trigger currently forbids `verified → ocr_needed`.**
`alembic/versions/d6d2fe8f27ae_data_source.py:119-134` raises on any UPDATE where
`OLD.status <> 'pending'`. `ingest_data_source` sets `verified` long before any parse ever runs,
so a later `verified → ocr_needed` UPDATE will raise. It fires for every role including the table
owner, by design — there is no runtime workaround, and building one would defeat a deliberate
DB-level guarantee that exists for good reason elsewhere in this table's lifecycle.

This is the **only** thing blocking SIM-350's detection-and-flagging goal from actually landing in
`data_source.status`. It's a `dd_owner` DDL decision — Vansh's call, not the implementer's:

- **Option A (recommended).** New migration replacing the trigger function body with: allow the
  UPDATE if `OLD.status = 'pending'`, **or** if `OLD.status = 'verified' AND
  NEW.status = 'ocr_needed'`; raise otherwise. Still enforced against every role, `ocr_needed`
  still terminal, the lifecycle stays a one-way DAG rather than becoming a free-for-all. No grant
  changes needed — `GRANT UPDATE (status, fingerprint, status_updated_at)` already exists
  (`d6d2fe8f27ae:110`). Keeps the `ocr_needed` value (and the frontend labels already written for
  it in `Simpero_AI_Gov_Web/src/hooks/useUploadDocument.ts:7` and
  `src/components/deals/DealDocumentUpload.tsx:21`) honest and reachable.
- **Option B.** Record `no_extractable_text` only in `analysis_run.parse_jobs` and never touch
  `data_source.status`. Zero migration risk, but `ocr_needed` stays permanently dead and the
  per-document status column silently misreports scanned files as `verified` forever.

If this decision is deferred, build everything else in this doc with the SIM-350 write stubbed
behind Option B, and revisit the `data_source` write later — nothing else in this design depends
on which option is chosen.

**Implementer trap on the SIM-350 write, either option:** `DataSourceRepo.update_status(id,
status, fingerprint)` writes `fingerprint` unconditionally (`DataSourceRepo.py:50-55`). The
`ocr_needed` call must pass **the row's existing `fingerprint`**, not `None` — passing `None`
wipes the already-verified hash, and the column grant will happily let that happen silently.

## Open questions for Vansh

1. **Trigger relaxation — Option A or B above?** Everything else in this design is unblocked
   either way.
2. **`conferenceMode` / `fixtureId`.** Still live in the frontend's Step 3 UI, sent by the now-dead
   `/api/simpero/analyse` call, with no fixture machinery anywhere in this backend. Remove the
   toggle frontend-side, or keep it and have this endpoint persist-and-ignore it? Excluded from
   the API contract above rather than silently inventing semantics for it.
3. **`selectedFrameworks`.** Currently defaulted to accept-and-persist in the contract above
   (nothing consumes it yet, but it's real user intent that otherwise gets lost when the
   frontend's localStorage draft clears on submit). Say the word and it drops from both sides.
4. **Worker-waits ceiling (D9).** ~10 concurrent analysis runs, and parse jobs serialize globally
   at the parser's `concurrency: 1` regardless. Acceptable for now?
5. **Deadline = 2 hours** (D8/D9), after which a run is marked `failed`. This number was picked,
   not derived — worst case is `N documents × (1800s parser timeout × 2 parser retries)`
   serialized on the parser side. Confirm or give a different number.
6. **Re-runs.** The partial unique index (D6) permits starting a new run once the previous one is
   terminal (`parsed`/`failed`). Assumed intended — flag if a deal should only ever get one run.
7. **OCR handoff.** The `no_extractable_text` → actual OCR execution (Textract / Claude Vision,
   whatever the MNPI-isolated leg ends up being) is named here only as a future boundary — this
   design does not trigger it, only flags the need for it. If SIM-350 is meant to *trigger* OCR
   rather than just flag-and-stop, that's a separate design.
